# Dynamic-inventory

Dynamic inventory using Jinja2 templates using ansible

Type `ansible-playbook mark1.yml -e '{"groupName":"host","hostList":["nishantparhi.com","google.com","facebook.com","amazon.in"]}'` to your shell, and then a file gets created called hosts in the give destination in mark1.yml

##### NOTE: In the proof I used `cat` command to show the result of the output file created, hosts
